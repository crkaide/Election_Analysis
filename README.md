# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
The client, Colorado Board of Elections, represented by its employees Tom and Seth, requested an audit of the recorded results for an election in one of the state's precincts comprised of three of its counties.  Initial analysis included: 1) a count of the total votes cast, 2) total votes by candidate, 3) percentage of total votes by candidate, and 4) the candidate that received the greatest number of votes (the winning candidate).  The client provided an initial data set and received: 1) the code file for future use, and 2) a .txt report of the requested results.

Following this initial audit, the client requested data disaggregated to the county level, reporting: 1) each county's voter turnout, 2) each county's percent of the total votes cast, and 3) the county with the highest recorded number of votes.

The client will receive three deliverables: 1) the amended code file, 2) the amended .txt report, and 3) this summary of the results.
